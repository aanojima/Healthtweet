Healthtweet
===========

Healthtweet is an interactive web-app for a range of audiences, from epidemiology researchers to the average sick person.  Healthtweet follows Twitter's data stream and grabs geolocated tweets referencing Influenza with updates by the hour.  Uses regex to parse tweets for ILI keywords and captures the coordinates and timestamp.  The web-app uses Google Maps and Charts Engine to plot ILI tweet trends on a time-space level.  Also contains some GUI for navigation between different layers of data, selecting specific times/regions, and for extracting data (very useful for researchers).
